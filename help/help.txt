What is this?
=============
C64AI provides interactive chat
with artificial intelligence on
the Commodore 64 (C64) computer,
while allowing you to listen to
SID music simultaneously. It 
supports the Commodore 1351 
compatible mouse.

Commands:
=========
/new       New chat

           Clears the chat
           history and starts a
           new conversation.

/lang=xxx  AI writing language

           AI responses are
           always delivered in
           the selected language.
           
           ex.: /lang=english

/sidfiles  Lists all SID files

           Lists the SID files on
           the selected disk
           drive. Displays the
           filename and block
           size. Click filename 
           to load SID file.

/load xxx  Loads & plays SID file

           The SID file must be a
           max. of 32 blocks
           (8KB). The load range
           must start at $1000.
           
           If a SID file has a 
           different load range,
           use the sidreloc 
           utility to relocate it
           to a compatible memory
           address before 
           loading.
           
           ex.: /load ace2.sid

/play      Plays SID file
/pause     Pauses SID playback
/help      Shows this help

           It can also be 
           accessed by
