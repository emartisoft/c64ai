# First, make systemd notice the new service file:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# To start the service immediately:
sudo systemctl start c64aiserver
sudo systemctl start gpio-shutdown
sudo systemctl start setup

# If you want it to run automatically during boot:
sudo systemctl enable c64aiserver
sudo systemctl enable gpio-shutdown
sudo systemctl enable setup

# To check its status:

systemctl status c64aiserver
systemctl status gpio-shutdown
systemctl status setup

# Real-time gossip line to watch logs:

journalctl -u c64aiserver -f
journalctl -u gpio-shutdown -f
journalctl -u setup -f
